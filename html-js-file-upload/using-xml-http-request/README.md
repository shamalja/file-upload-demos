# 📁 Multi-File Upload with Preview and Progress (Using XMLHttpRequest)

This project demonstrates how to build a modern, responsive multi-file uploader using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with the legacy `XMLHttpRequest` API. Users can preview selected images or PDFs, view a live upload progress bar, and receive real-time feedback after upload.

> ✅ Supports multiple file types (images & PDFs)  
> 🚫 Rejects files > 5MB or unsupported formats  
> 📊 Shows upload progress using a dynamic progress bar

---

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time preview of selected images
- Inline validation for file type & size
- Upload progress bar (using `xhr.upload.onprogress`)
- User feedback after upload success or error

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 (Responsive UI)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- `XMLHttpRequest` API
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (for local testing)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/shamalja/file-upload-demos.git`

`cd file-upload-demos/html-js-file-upload/using-xml-http-request`

### 2. Start local server

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then start the server in the project directory (file-upload-demos/html-js-file-upload/using-xml-http-request/frontend):

`npm http-server`

By default, it will run at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

### 3. Open in your browser

Copy and paste the server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080) into your browser to run the app locally.

### 4: Create a simple file upload server in backend (Node.js Example)

- Step 1: Navigate up from frontend to using-xml-http-request

`cd ..`

- Step 2: Enter the backend folder

`cd backend`

-  Install the required dependencies

`npm init -y`

`npm install express multer cors`

- Run the server

`node server.js`

### Final Testing Steps

- Go to your browser tab where Live Server opened the HTML page.

- Choose multiple images or PDFs.

- Click Upload

- You’ll see:
  - Progress bar updates
  - Preview thumbnails
  - Success or error message

Uploaded files will appear in the uploads/ folder.

## ✅ Browser Compatibility Notes for JavaScript Features

When using JavaScript for file uploads and user feedback, it’s important to ensure compatibility across modern browsers. Here are the key features used in this project and their browser support:

---

### 📦 FormData

Used to construct key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, especially for files.

✅ Supported in all major modern browsers:
- Chrome 7+
- Firefox 4+
- Safari 5+
- Edge 12+
- IE 10+ (Limited support)

💡 Note: IE10+ supports FormData but may lack full support for methods like .entries().

---

### 🔄 XMLHttpRequest.upload.onprogress

Used to monitor the progress of a file upload.

✅ Supported in:
- Chrome 7+
- Firefox 3.6+
- Safari 5+
- Edge
- IE 10+

⚠️ Note: For Internet Explorer, onprogress is supported only in IE10 and above.

---

### 🔁 Array.from()

Used to convert FileList to an array for easier manipulation.

✅ Supported in:
- Chrome 45+
- Firefox 32+
- Safari 9+
- Edge 12+

⚠️ Fallback Tip: Use [].slice.call(files) as a polyfill for older browsers.

---

### ✅ Progress Element (<progress>)

Displays visual feedback of the upload progress.

✅ Supported in:
- Chrome 6+
- Firefox 16+
- Safari 6+
- Edge
- IE 10+ (with limited styling)

🎨 Note: Custom styling of the <progress> element may behave differently across browsers.

---

### 🧪 How to Ensure Compatibility
✅ Always test your upload forms in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

✅ Consider polyfills or fallback methods for older browsers.

✅ Use feature detection where possible instead of browser detection.
