# 🌐 Accessible HTML File Upload – Best Practices Demo

This project demonstrates accessible file upload patterns in **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** based on WCAG 2.1 and ARIA guidelines.

It showcases common accessibility issues in traditional file uploads and provides inclusive, screen-reader-friendly alternatives using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

---

## ✅ What's Included

This demo covers five key accessibility improvements:

### 1. **Proper Labeling**
Uses `<label>` and `aria-describedby` to clearly define file input purpose and helper instructions.

### 2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
Accessible `<input type="file">` paired with screen-reader-only labels and contextual guidance.

### 3. **Drag-and-Drop with Fallback**
Includes a visually rich drop zone *and* a keyboard/screen-reader-accessible fallback input field.

### 4. **Upload Feedback with ARIA Live Regions**
Uses `aria-live="polite"` to announce upload progress and completion to assistive tech users.

### 5. **Fully Accessible Combined Example**
Applies all best practices in one seamless form.
